# Compares Android-TARGET.mk files generated by the mixed build
# against the same file generated by the reference build.
# This is the wrapper around build/bazel/mkcompare tool
# Usage:
#  mkmodules_diff [--bazel-mode-staging] <mkcompare_option> ...
# Android-TARGET.mk files that are compared are for the product
# defined by the TARGET_PRODUCT and TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT environment
# variables.
# Without --bazel-mode-staging option, the mixed build is run with
# --bazel-mode-dev option.
# The output can be safely redirected to a file, it does not include
# the noise from the build.
