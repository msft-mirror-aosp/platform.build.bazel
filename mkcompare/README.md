# Compare generated Android-TARGET.mk makefiles #

This tool shows the differences between two `Android-`_target_`.mk` makefile.
In the description below the first file is called 'reference makefile`, and
the second one is called 'our makefile'. We assume that the reference makefile
was generated by the pure Soong build, and that our makefile was generated by
the mixed build for the same configuration (i.e., the same  _target_ value,
and our goal is thus to find out the difference that mixed build introduces.

At the moment the comparator inspects only the module sections of a file.
A _module section_ looks something like this:
```makefile
include $(CLEAR_VARS)   # <module type>
LOCAL_MODULE := mymod
LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS := ETC
include $(BUILD_PREBUILT)
```

i.e., it always starts with `include $(CLEAR_VARS)` ('module header') line
and spans until the blank line. Before a blank line there is an
`include <mkfile>` line ('module footer'), which may be followed by a few extra
variable assignments. Between those two `include ` lines are the assignment lines.

The name of the module is synthesized from the value of the `LOCAL_MODULE` variable
and target configuration, e.g, `apex_tzdata.com.android.tzdata|cls:ETC|target_arch:arm64`
or `aac_dec_fuzzer|cls:EXECUTABLES|host_arch:x86_64`

The module header includes the module type as a comment (the plan was to use the
_mkfile_ on the footer line, but it proved to be common to most of the modules,
so Soong was modified to provide a module detailed module type as a comment
on the header line).

A module section in the reference file is compared with the
identically named module section of our file. The following items are compared:
* module types
* the number of extra lines following the section footer
* the variables and their values

Use JSON query tool like [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) to slice and dice it.

## Options ##
The comparator optionally:
* Generates a JSON file with all the differences (`-json`). This option turns off all out output.
* Stops after finding given _N_ different modules `-m N`)
* Ignores variables with given names (`--ignore_variables=VAR,...`)
* Shows per-variable value difference (`--show_module_diffs`)
* For each module type, shows the names of the modules with this difference (`--show_type_modules`)
